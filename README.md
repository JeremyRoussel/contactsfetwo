This is a simple Front-End for a locally hosted database of contact information.

It currently mirros the database into local state and modifies both at once, but is being updated to use redux to control the state and pass needed CRUD operations directly to components that need them.

It is paired with the database hosted here: https://github.com/JeremyRoussel/ContactsDB
